                    Kindly have a look at the terms and conditions of Bestflightdeals ltd. as we provide our services
                    in accordance with the following:

                <p class="h4 block-title my-3">Pricing</p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    We make use of third party data in the pricing of flight bookings etc. The third parties involved
                    utilize several techniques to gain information which also includes holding cached data. It is a
                    possibility that the data collected may sometimes, be a little old or out of date and may offer
                    flight options that are no longer available at the old price (or not available at all).
                    While we try our best to regularly update the data and make it accurate, occasionally it might not
                    be possible for us to honor the fare shown, in such a case you will either be provided the same
                    service at a different price, a completely different service or a full refund. Technical errors are
                    an occasional occurrence and we do hold the authority to cancel any transaction at any time where a
                    product or service has been sold or quoted at an incorrect value.
                </p>

            <div class="col-12 mb-3">
                <p class="h4 block-title my-3">Your contract</p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    When you book a flight with us, you are entering into an official contract with us. We will provide
                    you with the booking confirmation details, an invoice verifying the booking details and the payment
                    done by you. If you have booked with us offline, through a sales consultant, we will still send you
                    an email first in order to confirm the booking details (including the dates, destination,
                    passengers’ names and the cost of flight(s) booked).
                </p>

            <div class="col-12 mb-3">
                <p class="h4 block-title my-3">Payment terms and payment methods</p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    The person under whose name the booking is made becomes responsible to make payment(s) to us for
                    themselves and any other passengers under their booking as well. Generally, we request full payment
                    for the bookings at the time of booking; in certain cases when full payment is not crucial, a
                    non-refundable deposit is to be made in order to secure the booking. It must be noted that deposits
                    do not ensure a fixed fare, they only ensure a fixed seat (fares may fluctuate with time), and that
                    deposits are non-refundable. Fares can change at any time, without any notice; therefore it is in
                    the customer’s best interest to finalize the payment as soon as possible because fares can only be
                    guaranteed once the full amount has been paid. If you fail to make the payment within the given time
                    frame, your flight booking will be automatically cancelled. Should we have to cancel your flight
                    bookings because you failed to make the payment, you will be responsible to cover any cancellation
                    charges incurred.

                <p class="h4 block-title my-3">Amendments Reservation bookings</p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    if you wish to make any changes to your flight arrangements after having made a reservation and your
                    tickets have not been issued yet, we will try, to the best of our capacities, to accommodate new
                    instructions, so long as they are given to us in writing and are accompanied by an amendment fee.
                    Kindly contact your consultant for any further inquiries. However, it is important to note that
                    fares are only guaranteed once the full payment has been made by the customer and the tickets have
                    been issued.

                <p class="mb-1">
                    Once the tickets are issued, certain arrangements cannot be altered and any changes applicable will
                    incur a 100% cancellation fee. However, certain tickets are alterable, where the airlines charge a
                    fee for date change and some fare difference might also be applicable. An administration fee too
                    will be applicable. For detailed information about fare rules, date change and cancellation charges,
                    kindly contact your consultant.

            <div class="col-12 mb-3">
                <p class="h4 block-title my-3">Name changes/amendments</p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    once a booking is confirmed, alterations are not allowed to the name of the passengers. Therefore,
                    it is your responsibility to make sure that you make the booking(s) under the correct name(s) - as
                    appearing on the passports. Most airlines do not allow name changes; any attempt to do so will be
                    treated as a cancellation and cancellation charges will also be imposed. However, some airlines do
                    permit alterations for misspelled names after imposing an amendment fee.

            <div class="col-12 mb-3">
                <p class="h4 block-title my-3">Cancellation by the passenger </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    Majority of discounted flight tickets with low-cost carriers and ‘no frills’ airlines have a 1005
                    cancellation fee applicable; if this is not relevant to your booking, then you can cancel your
                    booking 48 hrs prior to your departure, by communicating the cancellation request to us in writing.
                    As this brings up administration charges, we will charge you for that, besides any cancellation
                    charges/fees imposed by the airline.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    Cancellation charges depend on the fare type of the flight, which can vary from 25% to 100%; be sure
                    to check this at the time of the booking. If the reason for flight cancellation is covered by your
                    travel insurance then you might be able to claim. Refunds take 8-10 business days to process and
                    reflect, as soon as the necessary documents for cancellation have been sent to the airline agents.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    Note that if you have checked-in online for your flight, then you will need to directly contact the
                    airline for cancellation otherwise they will treat you as a No Show and cancellation charges will be
                    applicable as part of the No Show rule. Most airlines impose a 100% cancellation charge on a No
                    Show; therefore, the ticket is also non-refundable and will only be refunded for exceptional taxes
                    where tax refund is applicable.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    Cancellation charges for flight bookings are subject to the terms and conditions of the main
                    supplier. Most flight tickets are non-refundable. Kindly check the terms and conditions before3
                    finalizing your bookings.

                <p class="mb-1">
                    Travel insurance is very important, especially if you are travelling abroad. It can be very
                    difficult to afford emergency medical/legal help, if it is not covered by a travel insurance policy.
                    It is your responsibility to make sure that the travel insurance that you purchase covers all your
                    requirements.

                    Our prices include the basic baggage allowance of most airlines. Some ‘no frills’ airlines may
                    charge you extra for baggage carriage. All of the additional baggage fees must be paid prior to your

                    check-in at least 3 hrs prior to your flight; you can either do that via the airline’s website and
                    will require the Airline Reference Number or your E-ticket number, both of which can be found on
                    your E-ticket.
