                </ul>

                <p><u>How do we collect your data?</u></p>
                <p>Bestflightdeals will collect only that data which complies with your local data protection laws.
                    Usually, customers’ personal information is collected through the data hat is provided to us by the
                    customers themselves during the course of your contract with us. We will always collect any
                    information regarding you, directly from you, unless it is absolutely, difficult or impractical to
                    do so.</p>

                <p>Typically data collection occurs:</p>
                <ul class="pl-3 mb-3">
                    <li>When the customer is dealing with us via email, telephone or in person</li>
                    <li>When customers visit our website</li>
                    <li>When customers connect with us on social media</li>
                    <li>We may also collect information about customers when they make inquires about or purchase any
                        travel arrangements or related products
                    </li>
                    <li>When individuals enter contests, competitions or register for promotions</li>
                    <li>When customers subscribe to our website (e.g.; newsletter etc)</li>
                    <li>When customers request any information or brochures from us</li>
                    <li>When customers use our services on the official website or social media page</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Unless you are using a pseudonym, we may collect information about you (apart from sensitive
                    information) when you fill out forms, surveys or give us feedback.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In certain circumstances, it becomes necessary for us to collect data about our clients from a third
                    party. For instance- situations when someone else makes a booking for you or someone books services
                    that are to be used by you (e.g., your employer booking a flight for your work trip). When this
                    happens, we will expect to collect some details about you from the third person making the booking
                    on your behalf.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, when you make a reservation or a booking on behalf of someone else, you
                    automatically agree that you have full consent of the other person (have brought this to the
                    person’s notice) for providing their information on their behalf to our team at Bestflightdeals,
                    who can further use/disclose that information to make the necessary travel arrangements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a case where you find that your information might have been wrongfully disclosed to us by another
                    person without your full consent OR if you did not get the other person’s consent to be handing out
                    their information, you must instantly contact us.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>We only process customers’ information where:</p>
